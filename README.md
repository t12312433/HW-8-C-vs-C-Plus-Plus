- Author: Thomas Parreco
- Affiliation: UMBC - Cmsc 313, M-W 8:30-9:45

## PURPOSE OF SOFTWARE:
This software was created for submisson to HW 8 for Cmsc 313 at UMBC, and is a matrix library in C and C++.
That has the functions of matrix addition, scalar matrix multiplication, matrix transposition, and matrix multiplication.

## FILES:


## BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Use the following command to compile:
   ```
   make
   ```
3. Run the test program:
   ```
   ./main
   ```

## TESTING METHODOLOGY:
- Test matrix operations: addition, scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication, and transpose.
- Validate results with sample matrices and known expected outcomes.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
- Compiled using GCC for x86 architecture.
- Written to comply with C99 for the C version and standard C++ practices for the C++ version.
