# Matrix Library - C vs C++

## AUTHORING:
- Author: Thomas Parreco
- Affiliation: UMBC - Cmsc 313, M-W 8:30-9:45

## PURPOSE OF SOFTWARE:
This software was created for submisson to HW 8 for Cmsc 313 at UMBC, and is a matrix library in C and C++.
That has the functions of matrix addition, scalar matrix multiplication, matrix transposition, and matrix multiplication.

## FILES:
- Matrix Program C++ - Folder containg the C++ matrix files
- Matrix.cpp – Implementation of the Matrix class in C++
- Matrix.h – Header file for the matrix class
- main.cpp – Main driver program using the matrix class to solve the specified problem
- makefile – Build instructions for the C++ program

- Matrix Program C  - Folder containg the C matrix files
- Matrix.c – Implementation of matrix operations in C
- Matrix.h – Header file for matrix operations
- main.c – Main driver program using the matrix functions to solve the specified problem
- makefile – Build instructions for the C program

## BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the directory of either the C or C++ matrix program
3. Use the following command to compile:
   ```
   make
   ```
4. Run the test program using make run or make run-val for memory checking
     ```
   make run
   ```
      ```
   make run-val
   ```


## TESTING METHODOLOGY:
- Test matrix operations: addition, scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication, and transpose.
- Validate results with sample matrices and known expected outcomes.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
- Compiled using GCC for x86 architecture.
- Written to comply with C99 for the C version and standard C++ practices for the C++ version.
